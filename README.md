# Nwalsh-Final-Project


What I Have Completed

So far, I have completed the main page of the project. The main page includes a title and a header, as well as a pizza customization section.
This pizza customization section includes two option menus to choose the size and sauce of the pizza and a total of 16 check buttons for all the toppings.
The main page also has two buttons located on the bottom left and right sides, "exit menu" and "proceed to checkout".
When you click the exit menu the application closes and for now the proceed to checkout takes you to a blank window with a title and an icon.

What Problem I Have

My problem as of now is grabbing the checked toppings and writing them on the proceed to checkout page.
Right now, I'm trying to get all the values through a list and the .get() function in tkinter.
With this, I should be able to grab the onvalue and dispose of all the toppings that aren't checked.
You can see my work so far, commented out, in the "appendList" function.

What is My Next Step

My next step is to complete the proceed to checkout page.
I want this page to allow users to enter their payment and address info for the pizza delivery.
I will also edit the design to make sure the user knows this is a pizza delivery app.
Finally, I want to add a final window that lets the user know their pizza was successfully ordered and that it's on the way.
